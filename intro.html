        You might expect that the paragraph I am writing right now is going
        to be displayed as two paragraphs because of the fact that I am
        

        going to separate them by spaces like this. However that is not 
        the case, as you might see by running it. It ignores the spaces.

        When the browser encounters new lines like this in your HTML, it will
        compress them down into one single space. The result of this compression
        is that all of the text is clumped together into one long line.

        <p>If you want to create paragraphs in HTML, we need to use the paragraph
        element like in this case, which will add a newline after each of our
        paragraphs. A paragragh element is defined by wrapping text content with
        a p tag.
        </p>

        <p>Headings are different from other HTML text elements: they are 
        displayed larger and bolder than other to signify that they are headings.

        There are 6 different levels of headings starting from h1 to h6. The largest
        and most important heading is h1, while h6 is the tiniest heading at the 
        lowest level. Let's see them in action.
        </p>

        <h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
        <h2>This is a heading 2</h2>
        <h3>This is a heading 3</h3>
        <h4>This is a heading 4</h4>
        <h5>This is a heading 5</h5>
        <h6>This is a heading 6</h6>

        <p>Using the correct level of heading is important as levels provide
        a hierarchy to the content. An h1 heading should always be used for the
        heading of the overall page, and the lower level headings should be used 
        as the headings for content in smaller sections of the page.
        </p>

        <p>I am a <strong>strong</strong> element. To word strong is enclosed with
        strong tag to make it bold and to mark it as semantically important.</p>

        <strong>You can use strong on its own!</strong>

        <p>The em element makes text italic. It also semantically places 
        emphasis on the text, which again may affect things like screen readers.
        </p>

        <p>I have an <em>emphasized</em> word. To make the word emphasized italic
        as in previous sententence we wrap the word in a em tag.</p>

        <em>I am an emphasized element and you can use me on my own too.</em>
