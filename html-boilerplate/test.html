    hello guys
    <p>How cool is just typing ! and enter key and have all the <br>
    boilerplate code set for you in vs code.</p>
    <p>Try it and you're gonna love it!</p>
    <p>Yet another thing I learned today is to render your html file <br/>
    from the command line, just navigate to the folder having your file <br>
    and enter 'google-chrome  <filename>.html' without the quotes and voila.</p>
